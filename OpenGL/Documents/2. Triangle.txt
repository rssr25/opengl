In legacy opengl (which I did in college), the creation of triangle was a piece of cake. Now with modern gl, to create a Triangle, you need two things:
1. Vertex Buffer: An array of bytes of memory in the GPU 
2. Shader: just a program that runs on the GPU

OpenGL works like a state machine. What we mean by this is that you set a series of states. Essentially you say:
"Hey I want you to select this buffer"
"I want you to select this shader" 
"now I want you to draw a triangle"

Based on which buffer and which shader is selected determines what triangle is going to be drawn. Knowing this is VERY CRITICAL. 

DOCUMENTATION: docs.gl website

In openGL you have to BIND EVERYTHING because that's how it is going to work. 
Let's write the shader for the triangle now.
