Texture is essentially an image that we use when we are rendering something.
I can make an image, and upload it to the GPU memory and then use it in the shader. 

1. We load our image
2. Convert it to texture using OpenGl
3. Bind that texture
4. Bind that texture with the shader using a slot we bound our texture to
5. Sample that texture in our shader
6. When we draw a rectangle, we should see the texture

In OpenGL we have verious slots that we can bind textures to. It depends on the device and platform and actual gpu you have. On computer we have
32 slots, on a mobile phone we may have 8 slots. Modern GPUs have 32, mobile GPUs have roughly 8

Set the texture parameters. Then load it to OpenGL. Internal format and format have huge differences. Internalformat
will tell OpenGL how to deal with the data (GL_RGBA8) while the format is the format of the data that you're
providing your opengl with.

Now, we need to tell the shader which texture slot to sample from and the way we do it is using uniforms. So we add that
function in shaders. This function takes in an Int passes it to the GPU. this int will tell GPU where the sampler
for the texture is.

Next we need to tell what are the texture coordinates
WE DID IT! WE HAVE A PICTURE AS A TEXTURE. 
The alpha channel may not get properly rendered until we enable the Blending in OpenGL. Let's enable it then.
