Now that we have done so much, we have the ability to put all those concepts together and do 
more complex things using them. So we have to setup some kind of tests/scenes which will help
us understand that a particular functionality is indeed working as expected. These tests/scenes will
demonstrate one concept working. 

We are essentially making a library of examples of all the different concepts. To to that we need to 
create an application first that is capable of doing that. The way that we are going to do is very simple. 

we are going to have a menu in ImGui that will have all of those scenes/tests/example. When we click an
option in the menu, it will open the scene specific controls and when we hit return key, it is going to go back
to go back to the menu and destroys that scene. 

Creating Tests in OpenGL:
In our Test.cpp we have not made the functions pure virtual so that we don't have to implement all of the
members in the classes that are extending Test.
TestMenu class will do two thinngs  (Test.h)
1. It needs to contain a collection of all the tests and we need to locate the different tests.
So we need a pointer to a Test class instance but also want to store a name that we can provide that appears
for the button of the test.

Now what we want to do is when we start a test we don't need the Test class poiinter already created. We
want to create a new Test class object for every test and destroy it when the test ends. So for that we
are going to use a function (lambda) that returns a Test class pointer and takes nothing.
Now we also need the currentTest's pointer. This is done by a private veriable m_CurrentTest (pointer to the address)
