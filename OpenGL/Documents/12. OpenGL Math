GLM is a header file library, so we don't need to create linker directories and stuff. 
A projection matrix is a way to tell our window how we want to draw all the vertices in it.
Let's have an intro to projection in code. 

In Orthographic projection things don't get smaller if they are farther away unlike perspective projection.
Now we have our orthographic projection matrix, let's give it to teh GPU to do the matrix multiplications for us. 
We call it modelViewProjection matrix.
