Create the empty project.
Download GLFW from website as a windows binary
Create the src folder in the "Show all files" view of the solution explorer
Add main.cpp and write the GLFW test program in it.

In the directory where the .sln file is, create a folder called "Dependencies > GLFW"
In this folder copy the "include" and "lib-vc2017" folders
Now we have to link these to the visual studio.


Go to project's properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories (Make sure the Configuration is "All Configurations")
Write "$(SolutionDir)Dependencies\GLFW\include"

Then Linker > General > Additional Library Directories and add "$(SolutionDir)Dependencies\GLFW\lib-vc2017"
Then Linker > Input > Remove everything from Additional Dependencies because they are included by default
Then Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies > Add "glfw3.lib"

Hit ok.

The program will compile successfully but not link so if you build it's gonna give a lot of errors. This is because we haven't linked OpenGL as of now. So let's do that. 
Then Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies > Add "opengl32.lib"
