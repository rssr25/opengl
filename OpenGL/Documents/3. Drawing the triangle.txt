glVertexAttribPointer() tells the computer that this is the layout of my memory. 
A vertex contains vertex positions and a whole lot of other data. Vertex Positions and Vertex are not same as far as we are concerned in OpenGL.

Now that we have the attributes to the vertex added, let's add the code to the GPU to make it understand about the vertices. 

The vertex shader gets called for each vertex and the fragment shader gets called for each fragment. Therefore any calculation inside the shader is going to get called a lot of times. 

Finally, let's write the vertex shaders. 
We wrote the vertex and fragment shaders in the same file and segregated them programatically.
