1. Renderer
2. Vertex Buffers
3. Index Buffers
4. Vertex Arrays

What is the purpose of the abstraction? So that you can say that these are the things that I need. 
Based on those things now let's build the functionalities.

For us what the vertex array needs to do is hopefully tie the vertex buffer with some kind of layout.

So what we want to do include in vertex array abstraction is the information about the vertex buffers and
their layouts. 

Next up is the abstraction of the Shader code. So what exactly we need to abstract in out shader code?
1. Pass a file and have that be compiled as a shader
2. We want to be able to bind and unbind the shader
3. We want to be able to assess the all the different uniforms for the shader.

That's probably it for something that we are doing right now.
